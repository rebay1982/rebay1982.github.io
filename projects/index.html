  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>Hey there! Thanks for your interest! This section encompasses a collection of projects I&rsquo;m currently working on. My main
objective with these projects is to satisfy my curiosity and learn how to solve new problems (for me). I&rsquo;ll be sharing
my findings and breaking down the learnings done for each project into different parts. Bonus points, all the projects
are public on my github so you can follow along with complete working examples. I will be linking the repositories here
as well for convenience.</p>
<p>Enjoy! Hope you find something interesting or that motivates you to start building your own stuff!</p>
