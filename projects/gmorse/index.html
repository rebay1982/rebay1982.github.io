  <h1>GMorse - A complete morse code decoder from scratch</h1>
  <p>This project idea was born when I got my amateur radio license in 2024 and started poking around radio stuff. What I
find particularily interesting are the digital modes (computers talking over the radio) and continuous wave (CW). CW is
mainly used to communicate using morse code across the globe.</p>
<p>Although it is an obsolete technology, a lot of amateur radio operators learn it and continue to use it.  Yup, that&rsquo;s
right, if you hang up an antenna, get some radio equipment, and listen, you can still hear morse code being transmitted
in 2025.</p>
<p>This piqued my curiosity and as I was starting to learn morse code, I thought that it would be pretty cool to have a
learning aid that decodes it as it&rsquo;s received by the radio. Now, some radios have this built in (mine doesn&rsquo;t)
and you can find decoders for pretty cheap on Amazon, but what&rsquo;s the fun in that? I was wondering how to together a
software decoder decode morse by hooking up a computer to the radio. This project was put created specifically to answer
that question! So come on down the rabbit hole and let&rsquo;s a morse decoder from (almost) scratch.</p>
