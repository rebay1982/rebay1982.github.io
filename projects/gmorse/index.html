  <h1>GMorse - A complete Morse code decoder from scratch</h1>
  <p>This project idea was born when I got my amateur radio license in 2024 and started poking around radio stuff. What I
find particularily interesting are the digital modes (computers talking over the radio) and continuous wave (CW). CW is
mainly used to communicate using Morse code across the globe.</p>
<p>Although it is an obsolete technology, a lot of amateur radio operators learn it and continue to use and make contacts
using Morse code. Yup, that&rsquo;s right, if you hang up an antenna, get some radio equipment, and listen, you can still
hear morse code being sent in 2025.</p>
<p>This piqued my curiosity and as I was starting to learn morse code, I thought that it would be pretty cool to have a
learning aid that decodes Morse code as it is received by your radio. Now, some radios have this built in (mine doesn&rsquo;t)
and you can find them for pretty cheap on Amazon, I was wondering how to put a software decoder together and decode
morse by hooking up a computer to the radio. This project was put together specifically to answer that question so come
on down the rabbit hole and let&rsquo;s put one together from scratch.</p>
