<p>Hey, you actually checked out the about page! I&rsquo;m Reda, I work as a senior principal software engineer
for a cyber security focused company. I&rsquo;m currently based out of beautiful Quebec City, Canada. At my day
job, my main efforts are spent building software that helps teams better triage discovered vulnerabilities
across their organizations. Essentially, it allows them to focus on the important ones first.</p>
<p>I spend most of my free time reading and learning about different subjects including cyber
security, retro computing and retro gaming. I also spend an unhealthy amount of time
playing the electric guitar (98% metal, 2% rock if you have to ask) and looking at the sky through
telescopes. I am also a licensed amateur radio operator (<strong>VA2ZCL</strong>) and mostly interested in digital modes.</p>
<p>In any case, I have way too many hobbies to actually make good progress in any one of them.  At
least I stay busy and it keeps things interesting. This blog will be a collection of writings about
interesting bits and pieces I do related to these hobbies. If it&rsquo;s of any use to anyone, then great!
It was totally worth the effort.</p>
