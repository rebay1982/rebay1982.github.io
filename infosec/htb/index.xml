      <description>Intro Greetings, here is my write-up for the doctor HackTheBox machine. I hope you enjoy the read! If you&amp;rsquo;re in a hurry, skip to the TL;DR section at the end.
Doctor is considered an easy Linux box by HackTheBox standards. It&amp;rsquo;s a well rounded box because its solution is composed of a mix of basic enumeration, basic priviledge escalation and also some recent CVE exploitation that can be accomplished with off-the-shelf tools.</description>
