      <description>Intro Hello all and welcome to my write-up for the delivery HackTheBox machine. For those looking for a quick step-by-step guide, please skip to the TL;DR section at the end.
delivery is an easy machine, even by HackTheBox standards. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much more to it than reading and poking around but it still teaches us some basics enumeration, configuration and some password cracking with hashcat.
First things first. Let&amp;rsquo;s add the delivery.</description>

      <description>Intro Greetings, here is my write-up for the doctor HackTheBox machine. I hope you enjoy the read! If you&amp;rsquo;re in a hurry, skip to the TL;DR section at the end.
Doctor is considered an easy Linux box by HackTheBox standards. It&amp;rsquo;s a well rounded box because its solution is composed of a mix of basic enumeration, basic priviledge escalation and also some recent CVE exploitation that can be accomplished with off-the-shelf tools.</description>
