      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s finally done. Over the holiday period in 2020, I vowed that 2021 would be the year where&#xA;I solidified my credentials in cyber security. Move from a passive &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in security&amp;rdquo; to&#xA;walking the walk. The main objective is to eventually make a move into a cyber security centered&#xA;role. I think there are multiple ways of achieving this and they all require different levels of&#xA;efforts. This blog is one of them. I learned so much from reading articles and attending security&#xA;conferences over the past few years. Writing walkthoughs for challenges and HackTheBox machines&#xA;are a way for me to give back on the knowledge sharing front. It also serves as a reminder on how&#xA;I solved them too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
