<p>Well, it&rsquo;s finally done. Over the holiday period in 2020, I vowed that 2021 would be the year where
I solidified my credentials in cyber security. Move from a passive &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in security&rdquo; to
walking the walk. The main objective is to eventually make a move into a cyber security centered
role. I think there are multiple ways of achieving this and they all require different levels of
efforts. This blog is one of them. I learned so much from reading articles and attending security
conferences over the past few years. Writing walkthoughs for challenges and HackTheBox machines
are a way for me to give back on the knowledge sharing front. It also serves as a reminder on how
I solved them too.</p>
<p>Another way is to actually get certified from a leading authority on cyber security certifications
such as ISC2. For context, I&rsquo;m a member of the security champion chapter where I work. This group is
overseen by the security organization of the company and invites individual contributors and
managers who have an interest in security to participate in security activities. Whether it&rsquo;s
attending informative presentations, enforcing securty policies, or ensuring static analysis scans
are in place, the goal is to make the software development organization sensitive to security. Have
security be a part of the design phase instead of just implementing it as an after thought. Anyway,
the security group were organizing a CISSP study group for 2021 to get some of their members
certified. They also extended the invitation to security champions from the rest of the
organization. I saw this as a great opportunity and just jumped on it without really knowing what
I was getting in to.</p>
<h2 id="cissp-what-is-it">CISSP. What is it?<a href="#cissp-what-is-it" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So, what is the CISSP certification? It stands for Certified Information System Security
Professional. This is one of the oldest and most saught after cyber security focused certifications,
seeing its inception in the late 90s by the ISC2 organization. It is regularily regarded as a
&ldquo;mile wide, inch deep&rdquo; type of certification. It will attest that you have a basic understanding of
eight security domains. None of them are terribly technical but are more oriented towards process,
standards, implementing security controls, and overseeing their success. Now, this doesn&rsquo;t mean
there aren&rsquo;t any technical aspects to it. You will need to understand a good number of technical
details about network protocols, encryption algorithms, physical controls, and more. You need to
understand these technical details to make the best decisions regarding their implementation and
validating their efficacy in securing the assets you&rsquo;re tyring to protect.</p>
<p>For more details, I highly suggest checking out the official
<a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP">ISC2 CISSP</a> site. Do go over the
<a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#pills-1">&ldquo;Who Earns the CISSP&rdquo;</a> to see if it&rsquo;s the right
choice for your career aspirations.</p>
<h2 id="getting-certified">Getting Certified<a href="#getting-certified" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go over the details on what you need to do to get certified by ISC2 as a CISSP as this
information is already available on the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP">ISC2 site</a>.
What I will talk about, though, is the exam and what to expect from it.</p>
<p>There are two types of exams. The one in native English is composed of 100 to 150 questions,
depending and how much data is required to assess your knowledge. You dispose of 180 minutes to
complete the exam, regardless if it takes 100 or 150 questions for the assessment. The second exam
type is the exam in languages other than English. You are required to answer 300 questions over a
320 minute time period. The passing grade is 700/1000.</p>
<p>The questions cover all 8 security domains and you are required to select the correct answer out of
four available ones. This sounds relatively easy but the nature of the questions is what makes this
exam difficult. It&rsquo;s not a technical exam, and sometimes implementing the best technical control is
not the correct answer. This is where understanding the fundamental concepts is a lot more important
than memorizing which port number a certain service listens on.</p>
<p>Now that you know what you&rsquo;re up against, I&rsquo;ll walk you through how I prepared for this.</p>
<h2 id="how">How<a href="#how" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>How to get started studying to pass the exam for this certification is the big question. There is a
pletora of material out there ranging from payed video courses, Youtube channels dedicated to it,
books, practice exams, etc. I suggest you have a look at the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/"><code>r/cissp</code></a> sub-reddit. A good majority of people who pass the exam
will list the material they used for studying. They will also grade the material on how useful it
was to them. In any case, I&rsquo;ll be describing what worked for me in this article. Obviously this is
not a method that is garanteed to make you pass so your milage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-marathon">Preparing for the Marathon<a href="#preparing-for-the-marathon" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Regardless of the material you intend to use, the most important things you will need to establish
are</p>
<ol>
<li>A study plan.</li>
<li>Support.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a marathon that can span over multiple months so you absolutely need a plan with objective
milestones if you are to ever get this done. This not something you do in your spare time either.
You absolutely need to dedicate time for it and not just give it the time &ldquo;left over&rdquo; at the end of
the day. I think this is why it&rsquo;s important to make sure you really want or really need this. It is
a huge investment of your time and will require a good deal of sacrifices.</p>
<p>The other important aspect is having support. Whether it&rsquo;s your partner or colleagues at work, it&rsquo;s
good having people support you in this endeavour. The study group that was organized at work kept
me honest and reading through the material. People around you are in the same boat with the same
objective so there is a good deal of knowledge sharing and people helping each other out. Support
from my immediate family was really important as well. My partner understood how important this
certification was for me and supported me through it even when the going got tough (more on that
later). It&rsquo;s very important to recognize that they are sacrificing their time as well to help you
achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Now that we have the basics covered, time to find the study material and get started!</p>
<h3 id="assimilating-the-material">Assimilating the Material<a href="#assimilating-the-material" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The organizer of our study group suggested we use the
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-all-in-one-exam/9781260142648/">All-In-One CISSP (8e)</a>
by Shon Harris and read through the whole thing. This way, everyone in the group would have the same
baseline and understanding of the 8 security domains. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but reading 1200 pages
and remembering everything isn&rsquo;t part of my super powers. Right off the bat, I knew this would pose
a considerable challenge for me. I developped a strategy that served me well down the road, but more
on that later.</p>
<p>The group would meet for 30 minutes on a weekly basis, discussing what was read in the previous
week. We would dedicate 2 weeks for reading every chapter with longer chapters being allotted 3
weeks for completion. If you do some quick math, that&rsquo;s about 18 weeks (close to 5 months).</p>
<p>The fact that the group would set these milestones in reading the material kept me honest about
reading the book. My schedule looked something like this: I would spend about 1 hour and 30 minutes
3 week nights out of 5 every week reading the book. On weekends, I would wake up early and read for
3 hours on Saturday and Sunday mornings. That is about 10 and a half hours of reading every week.</p>
<p>This part of the plan was to assimilate the material, the support was from the group and kept me
on track. My partner also kept reminding me regularily that I had this commitment, especially on
days where I was tired and not motivated to crack the book open and get started. One again, support
is one of the most important and beneficial parts of this marathon.</p>
<h4 id="remembering-the-material">Remembering the Material<a href="#remembering-the-material" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>You actually learn a lot from reading but just reading wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. Not for me anyway. I
have a tendency to need to read and re-read things multiple times before they start  sticking. One
strategy I adopted is note taking while I&rsquo;m reading. This forced me to read and reprocess the
information while writing it down in a note book. I carefully picked definitions, lists and things I
thought would be important things to remember. The leader of the study group would also hint us at
things that would be important to have memorized for the exam. This allowed me to more easily
identify material that would be worth while to write down. This does take a considerable amount of
time but will pay off in the end. It generates valuable artifacts: Personal summaries of each
chapter. To give you an idea, the longer chapters generated close to 60 hand written pages while
the average sat at around 35 pages. I could now skim over my notes if I needed a refresher. If
the notes weren&rsquo;t enough, I could target specific parts of the book to re-read.</p>
<p>When I concluded a chapter, I would stop for the day and re-read my notes the next day. At the end
of each chapter, the book has about 40 comprehensive questions. I would answer them without looking
at my notes and book and then grade myself. This allowed me to map my knowledge gaps and identify
which domains I knew I needed to spend more time on during the study portion of the plan.</p>
<p>When I completed reading the book, I re-read my entire personal notes to refresh the material from
all the chapters. Some of them were read 3-4 months ago so the information had started to fade a
bit. I then tackled the 150 comprehensive questions at the end of the book. These question covered
the entire book so it was a good way to assess where I was positioned in my understanding and
knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="the-study">The Study<a href="#the-study" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>After reading the whole thing, it was time to study. My objective here was to &ldquo;use&rdquo; the knowledge I
had accrued to keep it fresh. For those who haven&rsquo;t read my <a href="/about/">about section</a>, I come from
a computer/software engineering background, not security or networking. I do not use this knowledge
or work through it on a daily basis so keeping it fresh proved to be a challenge.</p>
<p>The plan would be to answer practice tests. Every single time I would get an answer wrong, I would
write down the correct answer and try to understand why I got it wrong in the first place. This
would serve me well as refresh material in the last stretch of the studying effort later on. This
was actually a suggestion from our study group&rsquo;s leader &ndash; this is how he got through it. It
resonated well with me as this is how I used to study back in university to make the study material
stick: Answer all possible questions I could get my hands on. It worked well in the past so why not
now?</p>
<p>Again, the up side of this method is that I also ended up with notes I could review later on for
questions or portions I knew I had trouble with.</p>
<h4 id="choosing-the-practice-material">Choosing the Practice Material<a href="#choosing-the-practice-material" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Choosing the practice test material was also a suggestion from our study group leader: The
<a href="https://www.isc2.org/Training/Self-Study-Resources">Official Practice Tests</a> book offered by ISC2.
Unfortunately, I had access to the 2nd edition which didn&rsquo;t have the reviewed material for 2021 and
the renewed edition wasn&rsquo;t out yet either.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-all-in-one-exam/9781260142648/">All-In-One</a> exam
book also had a product key to access a large amount of practice questions, organized by domain. It
also allowed you to customize your exam too. More on that later.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-break-mistake-1">The First Break (Mistake #1)<a href="#the-first-break-mistake-1" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>After reading the book over 4-5 months, following a rigorous schedule, I decided I needed a little
break. I started off thinking maybe a week would be enough but that week extended into two weeks,
then three and finally 30 days. 30 days after I completed reading the book I still hadn&rsquo;t answered
a single question from a practice exam.</p>
<p>When I finally decided to get started, I came to the frightening realization that a lot of the
material now seemed very distant and I had trouble recalling the majority of it. I couldn&rsquo;t remember
acronyms, I couldn&rsquo;t remember security architecture and framework standards, I couldn&rsquo;t remember
network technologies, etc. My refresher notes were very useful in getting me back up to speed here.</p>
<p>I highly recommend taking a break after reading the book. It&rsquo;s important to let everything sink in
and take a break from it. This avoid you getting sick of it and abandoning the whole project all
together. It also reminds you that there are other things in life besides studying for the CISSP
exam. A word of warning though. Before you take that break, set a specific date at which you
will start working on the preparation and study again. Without a set date, you will wander and
procrastinate. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to forget what you just spend 5 months
learning. You will not want to get started with the questions because you know it will confirm that
you started forgetting the knowledge you worked hard to acquire. Just that thought is enough
to discourage most. So take a week or two but set a specific date at which you will start again.
It will avoid you unnecessary stress and limit streching the preparation out for nothing.</p>
<h4 id="execution">Execution<a href="#execution" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>As I briefly touched upon above, the plan is to answer as many questions as possible. Here&rsquo;s how I
organized the execution and how I used the practice exams.</p>
<p>I started by re-reading ALL my hand written notes from domains 1 through 8. Everything. If you&rsquo;ve
been following along that&rsquo;s close to 300 hand written pages. I was able to cut through that in about
3 days, spending about 1 hour and 30 minutes on it each evening.</p>
<p>From there, I tried two 100 question comprehensive exams. It had a mixed bag of questions from all
8 domains. The strategy I adopted is I would do a practice exam. This took around 1 hour and 45
minutes to 2 hours for 100 questions. The following night, I would go over the wrong questions,
understand why I got them wrong, write down the correct answer and the explanation of why it was the
correct answer. That took around 1 hour and 30 minutes to get through as well. One side note, I wrote
down questions that I wasn&rsquo;t sure about or &ldquo;best guessed&rdquo; the answer. After the exam, regardless of
if I got it  right or wrong, I would try to understand why the answer is correct and why the others
were wrong.</p>
<p>The results of these two first exams were OK. I managed to get in the low 70% mark. It was
encouraging to see that I was at least able to get a passing grade but it was way too close to call
myself prepared. To remediate that, I decided to re-read my hand written notes for each specific
security domain and then do a 150 question exam that covered the domain. This was to re-enforce my
knowledge of each domain before attemping an other mixed-bag exam.</p>
<p>The schedule transformed itself to something along the lines of one exam Monday or Tuesday with
a correction session on Thursday. Friday was off. Saturday morning would be an exam morning and I
would correct the exam on Sunday morning. That&rsquo;s about two exams per week so it took somewhere between
5 to 6 weeks of work to get through the 8 domains and 4 mixed-bag exams.</p>
<p>It had been fruitful. I had saturated the Official Practice Tests pool and was getting results in
the upper 80%, a way more comfortable position to be in.</p>
<p>This is when I should have scheduled my exam, but I didn&rsquo;t. For some reason, I was hesitant to call
myself ready. My summer vacation was right around the corner and I just decided to &ldquo;handle&rdquo; it when
I would get back from my time off. I also didn&rsquo;t want to risk failing the exam and have that event
drain my mood during my time off. So I took an other break!</p>
<h4 id="the-second-break-mistake-2----i-almost-quit">The Second Break (Mistake #2 &ndash; I Almost Quit)<a href="#the-second-break-mistake-2----i-almost-quit" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Coming back from my vacation, very refreshed, I needed more questions to answer. This is when I
registered my
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-all-in-one-exam/9781260142648/">All-In-One CISSP</a>
practice exam key and&hellip; sat on it.</p>
<p>That was it. I would come back from work exhausted every evening. I also wanted to do other things
with my time on weekends. I didn&rsquo;t have a fixed date to start getting serious about it again and,
the longer I waited, the less I wanted to get confronted with the reality that this hard earned
knowledge is slowly slipping away. My partner would ask me why I wasn&rsquo;t studying or working on some
practice exam. This is when I even seriously considered quitting. I had learned alot from this
experience, gained a lot of knowledge, the majority of the work was done so why would I bother to
get a certification or try to pass an exam anyway? I tried rationalizing not going through with it
to the end. I think the real reason is that I was affraid of attemping the exam and risking failure.
Regardless of all my efforts, my preparation, my dedication and perseverence, I was still convinced
that I had a higher chance of failing than passing.</p>
<p>During this time, my partner reminded me often how much it would be a shame to forfeit everything
at the very end without even trying. Not going through with it would also be unfair to her because
she sacrified a good deal of time of her own supporting me on this journey.</p>
<h4 id="the-wake-up-call">The Wake Up Call<a href="#the-wake-up-call" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Around 6 to 7 weeks pass between going on vacation and the wake up call from the study group leader.
We had had multiple conversations about being ready for the exam and that candidates that are
scoring in the high 80% on practice exams usually pass. He bluntly asked me what am I waiting for to
schedule my exam if I was already scoring good grades on the practice tests. Eveyrone in the group
either already successfully passed their exam during the summer or had the exam scheduled for early
October. Everyone passed and I am the only one that still hasn&rsquo;t at least scheduled it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a good answer for him&hellip;</p>
<p>I knew that without a date, I  wouldn&rsquo;t have enough healthy pressure to build a new study plan,
study, and work through the last set of practice tests. That evening, I did it. In early October I
scheduled my exam for mid-November. I gave myself 5 weeks to come up with a plan, execute it and be
ready for the exam on November 13th.</p>
<h4 id="the-last-stretch">The Last Stretch<a href="#the-last-stretch" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>The plan now was similar to the previous one, but a lot more intensive. I re-read everything I had
up until now &ndash; the hand written notes from reading the book earlier in the year and all the exam
correction notes I had taken. That was the first step to getting everything back in memory for me.</p>
<p>Over the following three weeks, I did 100 question practice exams for all 8 domains. As with the
previous set of practice exams, I would write down all questions I got wrong with the explanation of
why I got it wrong.</p>
<p>I usually had social gatherings (remote, thanks Covid-19) scheduled every Wednesday evenings that
I had to withdraw my presence from to get this done. The people from those gatherings were super
supportive and understanding and wished me luck. This, again, shows how support from your family,
friends, and colleages is such an important part of the journey.</p>
<p>By now, I was scoring in the high 80% again on every domain. I did enjoy the questions from the
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-all-in-one-exam/9781260142648/">All-In-One Exam Guide</a> a
bit more. They felt more oriented towards decision making than typical technical yes/no questions.
Questions needed to be read carefully to be able to answer them correctly. I did find myself getting
answers wrong because I mis-read a portion of the question. By now I was scoring between 85% and 90%
on each individual domains and I still had 8 days to go before the actual exam. That last weekend
was spent doing a comprehensive exam in the morning and correcting it in the afternoon. The first
two week nights of that last week were also spent doing an exam and a correction the following
evening.</p>
<p>Side note here, another thing I did find interesting with the
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-all-in-one-exam/9781260142648/">All-In-One Exam Guide</a>
practice tests is that the results for mixed-bag tests were broken down per domain. Although you
score a total of 85%, it&rsquo;s interesting to see if you at least have 70% in all domain. You could see
it in the exam results with this product and it proved to be useful to focus on certain weaker
domains.</p>
<p>And that is it. Still scoring high 80%. It was time to let everything sink in. At this point, there
isn&rsquo;t much you can do but rest and wait for the exam. Maybe a little touch up here and there but
there isn&rsquo;t time for much more. It&rsquo;s time to focus on getting enough rest, managing anxiety and
getting the exam done.</p>

<p>The exam was on a Saturday morning so I made sure to clear the remainder of my practice exams early
in the week and have a couple of days to relax a bit. I also had Friday off from work and a three
hour drive to Montreal ahead of me to get to where the test center is. My folks live in Montreal so
it was good opportunity to drive down there and spend some time with them Friday. I did take about 2
hours from my Friday afternoon to go over a few last minute material I knew I had trouble
memorizing. Also took a walk in the early evening with my mother where we spent some time looking at
the Moon and Jupiter in the sky. Essentially, keeping my mind off the exam. I then went to bed
around 8h30 PM to wind down and get ready to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stress this enough how important it is to be well rested for the exam. Not only will you
be a lot more focused during the exam, you will be more equiped to fend off stress, anxiety,  and
even panic. These can seriously distract you from the task at hand and you need to have the energy
to keep your emotions under control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pause here for a second. Besides being well rested and comfortable with the material, it is
imperative that you have faith in yourself. You got this. At this point, I was still worried about
failing but I switched my mindset from failure being catastrophic to failure being an inconveinience
of having to take the exam a second time in 30 days. I repeated to myself that I did everything I
could, I had seriously dedicated the time to learn, study, and prepare for this exam. I didn&rsquo;t
try to cut corners or take a cheap and easy route. If I did fail, it would have to be an outside
factor and not my knowledge or competence. Again, there is no reason for you to fail if you did
everything right. Have faith in yourself.</p>
<p>In the morning, I received multiple pictures and videos from my children and partner, expressing
their support and how much they believe I can pull this off. This unconditional support carried me a
lot and had to be the most heartwarming thing I have experienced in a long time. I&rsquo;m just
reiterating how important support from your family and friends is to get through these types of
things. I was more stressed about arriving on time at the test center than the actual exam and I
got there about an hour early. No big deal, they took me right in and the exam started.</p>
<p>Most people will tell you that the exam has no resemblance to anything they have seen in the past.
It is true to a certain extent and this is where the whole &ldquo;think like a manager&rdquo; thing comes from.
Don&rsquo;t try to solve for something specifically. There are no perfect answer. Just answers that are
not as bad as the others and this is good in my honest opinion as this is the kind of situation that
you will be dealing with as a CISSP. You will not have a perfect solution, only solutions where you
will need to find the best compromise. As far as question style goes, they didn&rsquo;t feel that foreign
to me &ndash; they seemed to line up nicely with what I had experienced from the Shon Harris
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-all-in-one-exam/9781260142648/">All-In-One Exam Guide</a>
book.</p>
<p>As for execution, I had gotten some hints from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/"><code>r/cissp</code></a>
sub-reddit about taking the first 20-25 questions slow as this is where the exam does its assessment
of which domains are your weaker ones. Regardless if this is true or not, I spent a solid 40 minutes
of my time carefully reading all the questions and their answers before answering. A lot of comments
come up that it is normal that you feel that you are failing the exam the whole time. After 25
questions, I couldn&rsquo;t say I felt I was failing but I couldn&rsquo;t say I felt I was succeeding either. I
was answering the questions to the best of my knowledge but no answer was coming up as &ldquo;this is
clearly the correct one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As you can gather from the majority of blog posts and posts in the sub-reddit about the exam, the
strategy is to quickly eliminate 50% of the answers, re-read the question, and pick the most likely
candidate in the remaining two. The exam is mentally exhausting in that sense. I was doing a lot
slower than the practice exams where I would, most of the time, find the obvious answer and spend
less than 20 seconds on a question. I was spending minutes and I was answering my 75th question when
I glanced at the clock. I had been working on this exam for 1 hour and 50 minutes. I did get a jolt
of adrenaline at that moment but had the energy to avoid it turning into panic. I had to pick up the
pace if I needed time to reach 150 questions to get a pass. I wanted to avoid a situation where the
exam goes over 100 questions and I only have 20 minutes on the clock to complete it.</p>
<p>I took a couple of minutes to gather my thoughts, refocus, and get back to work. I started reading
questions faster, reading the answers and making quicker answer elimination decisions. I stopped
over-thinking everything and just kept taking decisions on what I thought the best answer was and
move on to the next. 20 minutes later I was answering question 100. I clicked on what I thought was
the correct answer, clicked next, and the exam ended.</p>
<p>That was it. I either passed or failed miserably.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result<a href="#the-result" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about every one else, but I was expecting a lot of emotions upon receiving my result.
Whether I passed or failed, I knew it would be intense. I did remind myself a few times that the
result of failing would just be me having to drive back next month to take the exam again and having
to shell out more money for the exam fee. It sucks, but merely an inconvienience at this point.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I had been studying and preparing for this exam for the better part of the year.
Close to 10 months in total. Passing it would mean the end of this laborious schedule I had set up
for myself. I would be on my way to get endorced and certified as a CISSP &ndash; what I had set out to
do at the beginning of the year to solidify my credentials in cyber security.</p>
<p>Anyway, I walked up to the clerc at the reception, gave her my ID and she promptly gave me my result
sheet. I walked out of the test center and found a quiet spot where I feverishly looked for
&ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; on the paper I was handed. There it was, first word in the first paragraph.
&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t care to read the rest at this point and, as expected, a huge rush of
excitement, relief, and joy came through like an avalanche. I took a couple of minutes alone to
collect myself before calling home to inform my partner and kids that it was a success. Hearing
everyone cheer at the other end was great. I&rsquo;ll never forget it. They are the real heros here though
as they have been incredibly supportive, understanding, and have been putting up with my
unavailability for the past 10 months. I was now free to spend more time with them and appreciate
every single minute of it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The key take away is have a plan and stick to it. This is a marathon. Regardless of the resources
you will be using to learn the material, set goals and dates by which you want to get things done.
The study group at work helped me for the learning part and getting the book read cover to cover.
Note taking here is a must unless you can easily memorize 1200 pages. Notes will also serve you well
for reviewing the material later on if you need to.</p>
<p>The next thing you should prepare for is the studying part. Do practice exams. A lot of them. I
mainly used practice exams that came with the resources I used and it was enough for me. In total,
I did around 20 or 22 practice exams. Again, writing down every wrong answer and every good answer
I wasn&rsquo;t sure about. This is time consuming but will heavily pay off in the end as you can review
your weak spots and the concepts you don&rsquo;t understand well.</p>
<p>Support is also a super important part of the journey. Had I not had it in the moments where I
doubted myself or felt like quitting, I wouldn&rsquo;t be writing this article today. Be grateful for any
small thing someone does to help and support you. You are the one preparing for the exam and they
are the ones enabling you to do it.</p>
<p>Last but not least, believe in yourself. You got this. There is absolutely no reason for you to
fail if you took the time to seriously prepare for the exam. Rest well the night before. You will
need a good amount of energy to keep your focus and your emotions in check during the exam.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still with me, thanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed the read as much as I enjoyed
writing about this incredible journey that took up most of my year in 2021. On that note, I hope
to see you all again shortly as I should resume work on HackTheBox machines and other challenges now
that I have all this spare time on my hands!</p>
