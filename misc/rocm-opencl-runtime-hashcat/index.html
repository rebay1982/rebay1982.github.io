	<h1>Installing ROCm-OpenCL runtime on Arch Linux</h1>
	<time datetime="2021-02-05T00:00:00&#43;00:00">February 5, 2021</time>

  <p>Greetings folks, this is going to be a short but usefull one. For those in a hurry, skip to the
<a href="./#installation">Installation</a> section.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by setting context. What are we trying to solve here? We&rsquo;re here because we want to
&ldquo;recover&rdquo; some passwords using <code>hashcat</code>. We have been through the excellent Arch Linux Wiki
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hashcat">documentation</a> for installing <code>hashcat</code>, got
everything installed, tried using it, and got an error that the currently installed OpenCL
driver is unstable and cannot be used.</p>
<p>What is OpenCL anyway? It&rsquo;s a framework that allows developers to write applications that can run on
a variety of different processors without having to know much about the implementation details of
each one of them. It&rsquo;s out of scope for this article but more details about OpenCL can be found
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL">here</a>.</p>
<p>The other question that comes to mind is why should we care about OpenCL and why does <code>hashcat</code>
need it? Short answer is that computing hashes on the GPU is considerably faster than computing
them on the CPU. We can run <code>hashcat</code> with the <code>--force</code> flag to force it to use the CPU
to compute hashes for password recovery but it will take a lot more time to get the job done vs
using the GPU.</p>
<p>The target machine used for this article is a Lenovo T495s laptop. It has an AMD Ryzen 5 PRO CPU and
a Radeon Vega Mobile GPU. When going through the normal installation steps for AMD GPUs, we can
naively go with the <code>opencl-mesa</code> runtime first since the package is in the official Arch Linux
repository and it supports the open source <code>amdgpu</code> driver. This is the OpenCL runtime <code>hashcat</code>
considers unstable and refuses to run on. What&rsquo;s our open source alternative? the
<code>rocm-opencl-runtime</code> from the AUR.</p>
<p>This is where everything got complicated real fast. Adding to the complexity is insisting on
only using <code>pacman</code> as the package manager. For stubborn folks, there&rsquo;s always a way and that&rsquo;s what
we&rsquo;re going to prove here so let&rsquo;s get to work.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<h3 id="finding-the-right-repositories">Finding the Right Repositories</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we&rsquo;re going to checkout the ROCm Arch
<a href="https://github.com/rocm-arch/rocm-arch">repository</a>. It contains all the PKGBUILD files you will
need for what is in the official ROCm
<a href="https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime">repository</a>. Had we been using <code>yay</code> as
our package manager, we could have simply followed the
<a href="https://github.com/rocm-arch/rocm-arch/blob/master/README.md#installation">instructions</a> provided
in the ROCm Arch repository read me and be done with it. But that would have been way too easy.
Let&rsquo;s keep our heads down and carry on.</p>
<p>After checking out the repository, we&rsquo;re ready to start installing packages. The end goal here is
to get the <code>rocm-opencl-runtime</code> installed.</p>
<h3 id="installation-order-and-dependencies">Installation Order and Dependencies</h3>
<p>One does not simply install the <code>rocm-opencl-runtime</code> package. We need to manually install its
dependencies first.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a complete list of what we will need to install and in what specific order. There is a
possibility that some may already be installed. It&rsquo;s safe to skip those.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and install <code>hsakmt-roct</code>.</li>
<li>Build and install <code>llvm-amdgpu</code>.</li>
<li>Build and install <code>rocm-device-libs</code>.</li>
<li>Build and install <code>hsa-rocr</code>.</li>
<li>Build and install <code>rocm_cmake</code>.</li>
<li>Build and install <code>comgr</code>.</li>
<li>Build and install <code>rocclr</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we&rsquo;re done installing 1 through 7, we can finally build and install the <code>rocm-opencl-runtime</code>
package.</p>
<p>Something to note, the <code>llvm-amdgpu</code> package takes a while to compile and install. We can also
expect <code>llvm-amdgpu</code> to need extra dependencies not listed here. Install and carry on.
In my specific case, <code>z3</code> and  <code>ninja</code> were missing.</p>
<p>Once <code>rocm-opencl-runtime</code> is installed, we can move on to testing.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>We are now able to use <code>clinfo</code> to list information related to the OpenCL installation. It will look
something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ clinfo

</code></pre><p>Perfect, <code>hashcat</code> can now leverage the GPU through the OpenCL runtime we just installed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There you have it, we were able to get the <code>rocm-opencl-runtime</code> package installed by using
<code>pacman</code> only. Honestly, it would have been a lot simpler to just use <code>yay</code> but we demonstrated that
it&rsquo;s possible to do it with <code>pacman</code> with a little extra work. Bonus points, we were able to
&ldquo;recover&rdquo; passwords by having <code>hashcat</code> use the newly installed OpenCL runtime.</p>
<p>Hopefully these instructions have provided enough guidance to get everything running on your own
system.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I&rsquo;ll see you next time!</p>
